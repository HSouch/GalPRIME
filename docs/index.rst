GalPRIME is a code designed to automate the process of 1D Surface Brightness Profile extraction. It has tools to
automatically extract real profiles from a set of images (given an input catalogue). Its primary purpose, however,
is to determine the efficiency of profile extraction by injecting mock images into either real or simulated 
background images.
